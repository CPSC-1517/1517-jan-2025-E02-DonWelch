  //this setting variable will indicate the connection string for the
  //  application
  //the string needs the following:
  //  server name
  //  database name
  //  any other additional connection option
  //NOTE: you may run into an encryption problem or trusted certificate problem
  //Solution: for the encryption problem, add the parameter encrypt=false 
  //          for the certificate problem, add the parameter TrustServerCertificate=true
  //                true allows for: The client accepts the server's SSL certificate without validating it against a trusted CA
  //                                 Encryption is still applied, but there's no verification of the certificate's authenticity.
  //                                 Used when the certificate is self-signed or untrusted but encryption is required
  //                                 Risk: Vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks if the server identity isn't verified
  //               when to use: When using self-signed certificates for internal or development environments
  //                            When you're certain about the server's identity and trust the connection
  //                            When dealing with legacy systems that lack proper certificate infrastructure
  //               false allows for: The client requires a valid SSL certificate issued by a trusted CA
  //                                 If the server presents an untrusted or self-signed certificate, the connection fails
  //                                 Ensures better security by preventing impersonation attacks.
  //               when to use: In production environments where security is critical.
  //                            When using publicly trusted CA-issued certificates
  //                            When you want full encryption with certificate validation to prevent spoofing.

<h1>Hello, world!</h1>

<!--
    lets create a two column content area
    - the left column will hold an image
    - the right column will hold some text

    we will use bootstrap and div tags to split the content area

    the class row indicates an area that spans to content area with 12 equal compartments
    you can have several row classes within a single content area
    these rows can be stack or the can be nested

    the class col-ss-nn where ss is the compartment size and nn is a value between 01-12
    sizes: xs sm md or lg
    nn: represents the number of compartments you wish to "merge"
